\chapter*{Acknowledgments} 

First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Antonio Canale, for being a great mentor and for always finding the time to help me when I got stuck with some problem. His profound (and surprising) belief in my abilities has often been fundamental to persevere during my frequent research existential crises.

I would also like to extend my deepest gratitude to my co-supervisor, Prof. Michele Guindani, for the patient guidance and extensive knowledge. I am still amazed by his ability to answer every doubt with a list of ten papers to read.

\chapter*{Acknowledgments} 

First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Antonio Canale, for being a great mentor and for always finding the time to help me when I got stuck with some problem. His profound (and surprising) belief in my abilities has often been fundamental to persevere during my frequent research crises.

I would also like to extend my deepest gratitude to my co-supervisor, Prof. Michele Guindani, for the patient guidance and extensive knowledge. I am still amazed by his ability to answer every doubt with a list of ten papers to read.

I would like to extend my gratitude to Prof. Zhaoxia Yu and Prof. Annalisa Cesaroni for their useful advice, which significantly contributed to the positive fulfillment of this work. Thanks should also go to the reviewers, for their kind words and their suggestions, which led to a relevant improvement of the thesis.

Although not directly involved in the writing of this thesis, but whose role was fundamental for its success, are all my PhD colleagues, who shared the burden of this beautiful, and tough, experience. In particular, I would like to thank Jacopo, Anna and Mattia, who really helped me in many situations.

Special thanks should also go to Francesco, the best pandemic mate I could wish for to face the challenges of a lock-down and a visiting period, and especially of research during a lock-down and a visiting period.
